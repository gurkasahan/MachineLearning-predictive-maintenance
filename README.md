Machine learning project for predicting equipment failure using operational data, with real-time web app deployment via Streamlit. Customized for learning and demonstration purposes.

# Predictive Maintenance using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline to predict equipment failure based on operational metrics. The goal is to showcase how AI/ML solutions can be used to support proactive maintenance, reduce downtime, and optimize operational efficiency — aligning with industry applications such as transit operations, manufacturing, and logistics.

## 🔍 Overview

- **Model:** Random Forest Classifier  
- **UI:** Streamlit web app  
- **Dataset:** Synthetic dataset (10,000+ samples, 14 features)  
- **Output:** Binary classification — Predict whether a machine is likely to fail

## 🚀 Features

- Full data preprocessing: null handling, normalization, encoding
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature importance analysis
- Model training, tuning, and evaluation
- Streamlit-based deployment for real-time predictions
- Clean and modular code structure for easy extension

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy
